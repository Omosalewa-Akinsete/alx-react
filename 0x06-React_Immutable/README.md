0x06. React Immutable

0. Converting into an Immutable object using fromJS
Copy the necessary config files specified in the description to the root directory of the project and execute npm install.

In a file named 0-fromjs.js, create a function getImmutableObject that accepts object as a parameter and converts it into an immutable Map using fromJS of the Immutable.js library

1. Converting into Immutable using Map
In 1-map.js, modify the function getImmutableObject using Map from Immutable.js

2. Accessing nested elements
Given the function below, edit it to return the value of the object at the defined path

The first argument is a plain object
The second one is an array containing a list of a path to some key in the object
The function should return the value of the object at the defined path

Should return Guillaume
Requirements:

The function should either return undefined, a string, or a Map

3. List and push
In file 3-list.js, create these 2 functions:

getListObject accepts an array as parameter and converts it into an immutable List using the Immutable.js library
addElementToList accepts two arguments: first one is a List and second one is a string
append the string to the list and return the list

4. Chained mutations
Create & export a constant named map. It should create an Immutable Map with the following object:

Export a second constant named map2. It should use the first map and modify the following values:

Modify the value for the index 2, to Benjamin
Modify the value for the index 4, to Oliver
Requirements:

You can’t use any other variable than map and map2

5. Merge & concat
Create a function named concatElements

It accepts two arguments page1 and page2. Both are arrays
It should return a List containing the values of the two pages
Create a function named mergeElements

It accepts two arguments page1 and page2. Both are objects
It should return a List containing the values of the two pages
If two values are the same, page2 values should be used.
Requirements:

Use list and map from the Immutable.js library

6. Nested merge
Create a function named mergeDeeplyElements

It should accept two arguments, page1 and page2. Both are objects
It should return a List containing the values of the two pages
If two values are the same, they should combine each other

Requirements

use Map from immutable.js

7. Equality
Create a function named areMapsEqual

It accepts two arguments map1 and map2. Both are Immutable.js Maps
It should return true if the Maps are equal

Should return true

Requirements:

Use is from the immutable.js library

8. Lazy Seq
reate a function named printBestStudents:

It accepts one object as argument. The object is formed with the following structure:

Calling the function should filter any student with a score < 70 and print to the console the first name and the last name with the first letter capitalized:

Requirements:

Uses seq from immutable.js
